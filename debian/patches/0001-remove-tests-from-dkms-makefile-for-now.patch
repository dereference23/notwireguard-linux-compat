Subject: remove tests from dkms makefile for now

If we ship this include, then dkms builds fail because they're being
built from a different location, i think.  At any rate, for the normal
wireguard-dkms package installation, we don't want these live test
suites that talk to the public network, so that bit is probably fine.

```
